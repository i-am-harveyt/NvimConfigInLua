# Nvim Config in Lua

## Intro

This is a config that I've setup for my neovim use. And almost all comfig is written in Lua.

Someone may like auto-format when writing code, but I'm personally not a big fan of it.

When setting up this, I mainly refers to Cosynvim and Neovim-from-scratch. They are all very good ones, and I've learned so much from them. Even though I'm still not familiar of creating APIs and so many other cool stuff, Haha.

If you need a more well-configured, more fast and stable one, the two repos I've mentioned are good options, and I've used LunarVim and AstroNvim, both of them are good, I personally prefer the latter one.

I'm doing this just because I have some keymaps that I'm more familiar to, like `<Space>fs` stands for `save`, and `<Space>;t` stands for `:term`, and so on. Moreover, I personally don't use that much plugins, so I want to make something quite minimal. However, I have to say that, those configs that I've menthiond, are so much better than my work, so using my config may not be the best option for you.
